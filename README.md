I scored a Magnevation SpeakJet Activity Center on eBay for $20 and have been playing around a bit and discovered it's the same chip used in the [AtariVox+ Speech Synthesizer](https://www.atariage.com/store/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1045).

I decided to port the PhraseALator application to C#. Part of the process was to change from Mscomm32.ocx to .NET's SerialPort class in the System.IO.Ports namespace.
